### Package Managers
Everything in Libraries.io begins with [package managers](/packagemanagers.md). On a regular basis, background tasks find new or updated libraries from each of those packages managers. Libraries cannot be added to the system unless they exist on one of those package managers.

#### Projects, Versions and Dependencies
Each library is stored in the [Project](https://github.com/librariesio/libraries.io/blob/master/app/models/project.rb) table. If a library's package manager supports published version numbers, each new version is stored in the [Version](https://github.com/librariesio/libraries.io/blob/master/app/models/version.rb) table; and if the package manager supports library dependencies, then they are recorded in the [Dependency](https://github.com/librariesio/libraries.io/blob/master/app/models/dependency.rb) table.

### Repositories
Libraries.io will then augment package manager data with data from a Repository if one is referenced in the package manager. GitHub repositories will be downloaded and stored in the [Repository](https://github.com/librariesio/libraries.io/blob/master/app/models/repository.rb) table, on creation a background Sidekiq task is kicked off to download related information from GitHub including:

- [Readme](https://github.com/librariesio/libraries.io/blob/master/app/models/readme.rb)
- [Tags](https://github.com/librariesio/libraries.io/blob/master/app/models/github_tag.rb)
- [Contributors](https://github.com/librariesio/libraries.io/blob/master/app/models/github_contribution.rb)
- Owner ([GitHub user](https://github.com/librariesio/libraries.io/blob/master/app/models/github_user.rb) or [GitHub Org](https://github.com/librariesio/libraries.io/blob/master/app/models/github_organisation.rb))
- Source repository (if it's a fork)
- [Dependency Manifests](https://github.com/librariesio/libraries.io/blob/master/app/models/manifest.rb)

Some package managers that don't have a concept of published versions (like Go and Bower), often they will fall back to using tags from a source repository if available, Libraries.io attempts to use GitHub tags as a fallback for all package managers that don't provide version information.

### Licenses
License names are ran through [SPDX](https://github.com/librariesio/spdx). This standardises the many different ways of writing the same licenses into a single version, which is then used for filtering in search and listing on https://libraries.io/licenses. A library can have multiple licenses as it may contain other libraries with conditions that are enforced upward. If a project doesn't have any license data from the package manager then it will fall back to using the (singular) Repository license.

If a project has a non-standard or commercial license it's currently normalized to "Other" and is not indexed in search.

## Architecture
Libraries.io is made up of a number of micro-services that work together. The following diagram provides a high-level overview:
