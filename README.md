## Welcome to Libraries.io :tada:
Here you'll find guidance for contributors to the Libraries.io project as a whole.

### Assumptions
We have made the following assumptions in our guidance and documentation:

* that the reader has a basic understanding of the collaborative coding platform [GitHub](https://help.github.com/),
* that the reader has a working understanding of the distributed revision control system [Git](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial),
* that the reader is able to communicate, in writing, in English.

## Why Build Libraries.io?
_Our goal is to raise the quality of all software._

We do this by tackling three problems:

* Discovery: _Helping developers make faster, more informed decisions about the software that they use._
* Maintainability: _Helping maintainers understand more about the software they depend upon and the consumers of their software._
* Sustainability: _Supporting undervalued software by providing a scalable and sustainable revenue for maintainers_

Libraries.io is the place that we attempt to solve the discovery problem for users, we solve the other two at our parent company [Tidelift](https://tidelift.com). If you'd like to know why we think this is the right approach then check out [our strategy](/strategy.md).

### Who are Tidelift?
In October 2017 Libraries.io maintainers Andrew Nesbitt and Benjamin Nickolls decided to join a new company focussed on building a sustainable future for open source software. Tidelift launched to the public in February 2018 and continue to support Libraries.io as part of their core philosophy and strategy.

## Who is Libraries.io For?

Libraries.io currently caters for the needs of three groups:

* Google: is hungry for your linked datas so she can serve you up search traffic.
* Searcher: is a developer with a problem, she is looking for something to help solve it.
* Extender: has her own ideas. She wants access to the raw data so that she can mash up her own service and offer it to the world.

These groups have been expanded into [personas](/personas.md) for contributors to reference in their work.

## How Does Libraries.io Work?
Libraries.io collects data about software and the frameworks, plugins and tools they depend upon which we collectively call libraries.

Everything in Libraries.io begins with [package managers](/packagemanagers.md). On a regular basis, background tasks find new or updated libraries from each of those packages managers. Each library is stored as a project, alongside any data we can gleam from the package manager. If the package manager provides a link to a hosted revision control service like GitHub, then Libraries.io fetches yet more data from there.

Using the collected data, we highlight any issues regarding updates, deprecated versions, yanked or deleted libraries, license incompatibilities, etc.

If you'd like an overview of the project, including a description of each of the repositories in the Libraries.io organisation and how they work together, then check out our [overview](/overview.md).
