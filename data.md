## Data
Libraries.io gathers metadata about software from [33 package managers](/packagemanagers.md) and three repository hosts â€” GitHub, GitLab and BitBucket. 

The data we collect powers search on Libraries.io and other sites (if you'd like us to do that for you [get in touch](mailto:support@libraries.io)), helps us recommend projects, warn users of problems with their dependencies and compute a library's [SourceRank](/overview#sourcerank). 

### Downloading Libraries' Data

Data gathered by Libraries.io is available for download on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/808273#.WV35s9Pytcw). Documentation on what's included can be found at [libraries.io/data](https://libraries.io/data).

### Accessing Libraries' Data Programmatically

Libraries'[API](https://libraries.io/api) provides up-to-date information for a project, repository or user. 

Data is also available via Google BigQuery as apart of their [public datasets programme](https://console.cloud.google.com/launcher/details/libraries-io/librariesio)
