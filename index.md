### Are there any other things I should know?
The core team are responsible for the health and safe running libraries.io. They are the people who will be up in the middle of the night if the site is having problems. As such we need to be aware of our own skills and our ability to support others work. This is why we have both supported and unsupported [registries](/registries.md).
