## Strategy
libraries.io's mission is to raise the quality of *all* software. We will do this by raising the quality and frequency of contributions to free and open source software. Specifically we tackle three distinct problems:

* Discovery: _Helping developers make faster, more informed decisions about the software that they use._
* Maintainability: _Helping maintainers understand more about the software they depend upon, and producers to understand more about the consumers of their software._
* Sustainability: _Supporting undervalued software by highlighting shortfalls in contribution and funneling supportto them._
