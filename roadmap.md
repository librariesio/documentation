## Road Map

### 2017 Funded Commitments

Libraries.io is a project of Brave New Software. The project is supported by the following organisations until 1st January 2018:

* [Brave New Software](http://www.bravenewsoftware.org/)
* [The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation](https://sloan.org/programs/digital-technology)
* [The Ford Foundation](https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/challenging-inequality/internet-freedom/)

The [supporters repository](https://github.com/librariesio/supporters/issues) contains details of our commitments to our supporters throughout 2017. The main technical goals are:

- Adding support for projects hosted on GitLab and BitBucket
- Creating parity among the supported package managers
- Establishing a baseline of metrics to measure against
- Releasing metric and dependency graph information 
- Adding external metrics in Libraries.io meta-data

There are also a number of non, developer centered goals. Mainly these are about raising demand for and usage of Libraries.io as a service and as a source of data.

### 2017 Additional Goals

In addition to our funded commitments in 2017 we will prioritise:

- Adding support for projects hosted on SourceForge
- Adding more guidance for contributors
- Improving technical documentation
- Publishing our mission, strategy and philosophy

### 2018 Goals

We have a number of ideas that we are interested in pursuing in 2018:

- Monitoring system-level dependencies
- Bridging from application to system-level dependencies
- Federating search facilities to multiple providers
- Improvements to [sourcerank](/overview#sourcerank) 
- Gathering and sharing more metrics
- Identifying individual contributors with rights to publish updates

We will keep this document updated periodically. Please check our [issue tracker](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+org%3Alibrariesio) for more information.
