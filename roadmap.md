### 2018 Commitments
As part of Tidelift, the goals for Libraries.io become more focussed on solving discovery issues for our users. Our priorities for 2018 are:

- Redesigning Libraries.io to provide a more discovery-focussed user experience
- Adding time-series data to packages indexed by Libraries.io
- Improving our search facilities to include language, problem and domain-specific results,
- Federating our search and data facilities to users through our API,
- Continuing to support researchers through open access to data gathered by Libraries.io

This alongside our ever-present target to keep expanding the breadth of data gathered by Libraries.io and offering it to the world as a utility service provider.

### 2017 Funded Commitments
For much of 2017 Libraries.io was a project of Brave New Software. The project was supported by the following organisations until 1st January 2018:

* [Brave New Software](http://www.bravenewsoftware.org/)
* [The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation](https://sloan.org/programs/digital-technology)
* [The Ford Foundation](https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/challenging-inequality/internet-freedom/)

The [supporters repository](https://github.com/librariesio/supporters/issues) contains details of our commitments to our supporters throughout 2017. The main technical goals were:

- Adding support for projects hosted on GitLab and BitBucket
- Creating parity among the supported package managers
- Establishing a baseline of metrics to measure against
- Releasing metric and dependency graph information
- Adding external metrics in Libraries.io meta-data

There were also a number of non-developer centered goals. Mainly these are about raising demand for and usage of Libraries.io as a service and as a source of data.

### 2017 Additional Goals

In addition to our funded commitments in 2017 we will prioritise:

- Adding support for projects hosted on SourceForge
- Adding more guidance for contributors
- Improving technical documentation
- Publishing our mission, strategy and philosophy
