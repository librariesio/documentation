## How We Work
This document provides guidance on our working processes. How we communicate, how we ticket issues, how we contribute code, documentation, designs etc. and how we ensure that we are a growing group of happy, productive people. 

### Philosophy
Libraries.io is an open and inclusive [community of people](/contributors.md) working together. We expect contributors to abide by our [contributor terms](contributors.md) which basically say 'be excellent to each other'. 

We beleive strongly that if something is worth working on it should be written down, specifcally this should be in the form of an issue. If something is wrong, ticket it. If something is missing, ticket it. If something could be better... well, you might discuss it first, but then you'll probably ticket it. 

Similarly we think that how we work is as important as the work itself, which is why this document exists. The preceeding comment regarding ticketing applies to this document too. If something is unclear, ticket it. If something is unproductive, ticket it. If something is exclusive, ticket it. 

### Communication
We communicate predominatly in English. That is all contributions to the project should be made with English as the first language. We are happy for members of the community to communicate in a language other than English in chat, email and video but be aware that this might be considered exclusive and therefore against our philosophy if the working group is multi-lingual.

#### Chat
We use [Slack](http://slack.io) for chat. There's an open invitation avaialble to anyone who wishes to join the conversation at [http://slack.libraries.io](http://slack.libraries.io). Slack can be used in the browser or a [client for you operating system](https://slack.com/downloads).

We try to use the following channels accordingly:

* `#general` channel is used for general, watercooler-type conversation, contributor updates and issue discusion.
* `#events` is used to share and discuss events that may be of interest to or attended by members of the community
* `#activity` contains notifications from the various platforms that we use to keep the libraries.io project turning. Including notfications from GitHub, Twitter and our servers. 

Members are encouraged to openly discuss their work, their lives, share views and ask for help using chat. It should be considered a *safe space* in which there is *no such thing as a stupid question*. 

Conversely no one contribtor should ever be expected to have read anything said in a chat. As per our philosophy. If someone should know soemthing then it should be written down as an issue and/or documented in an obvious place for others to find.  

#### Video
[Google Hangouts](http://hangouts.google.com) is our preferred tools for video chat. We operate an [open chat room](http://bit.ly/2kWtYak) for anyone to jump into at any time to discuss issues face to face. 

#### Regular updates
Contributors are encouraged to share what they're working on. We do this through updates in the `#general` channel on Slack around 11am in your local timezone. Updates should take the format 'currently working on X, expecting to move onto Y, blocked on Z' where x, y and z are issues in our [issue tracker](github.com/librariesio/issues). 

Please be aware that contributors have different amount of time avaialble to contribute, work in different timezones and may have different working habit to other members. 

Additionally we host an open chat for any contributor to join at *5pm UTC on a Tuesday* to discuss their work, the next week's priorities and to ask questions of other contributors regarding any aspect of the project. Again this is considered a *safe space* in which *there is no such thing as a stupid question*.

#### Mail
The [core team](coreteam.md) operate a mailing list for project updates. If you'd like to subscribe you'll find a form in the footer on [libraries.io](http://libraries.io). 

We do not curently operate any mailing lists. If it becomes aparent that this would be a useful, additional mode of communication then Google's group-based mail subscription service would be our preference. 

#### Twitter
We have an account on Twitter at [@librariesio](http://twitter.com/librariesio). This is predominatly used to retweet news, events and musings by controbutors rather than as a direct method of commmunication. Contributors are encouraged to use @librariesio in a tweet when talking about the project, so that we may retweet is appropriate. The account is moderated and protected by the [core team](/coreteam.md). 

#### Facebook
We have a Facebook page at [@libraries.io](https://www.facebook.com/libraries.io). Again this is predominantly used to gather and reflect news, events and musings by contributors rather than as a direct method of communication. Contributors are encouraged to reference Libraries.io in a post when talking about the project, so that we may reflect this if appropriate. Again the account is moderated and protected by the [core team](/coreteam.md). 

#### Medium
We have a Medium account at [@librariesio](https://medium.com/@librariesio) and once again it is used to reflect news, events and musings by contributors rather than a direct method of communication. Contributors are encouraged to reference @librariesio in a post when talking about the project, so that we may recommend it if appropriate. Again the account is moderated and protected by the [core team](/coreteam.md). 

#### Marketing, PR and 'Corporate Voice'
Libraries.io is not a legal entity and it is not the product of any one individual. Nor should it be limited to the views and opinions of any one individual. Therefore libraries.io does not have its own voice and it does not do any direct marketing or PR. We rely on our community to think about, write and share their views in line with our open and inclusive philosophy. And we will do everything we can to gather and reflect this on the above channels for the other members of the community. 

### Workflow
Libraries.io is predominantly a software application. Most of the contributions to the project will be in the form of code. Therefore it follows that the general workflow should offer the best fit with the [developer workflow](/developerworkflow.md). If anything in the workflow seems overly taxing or irksome it is because it makes the process clearer for many other contributors.  

In general we use [GitHub](https://help.github.com/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial) to support our workflow. If you are unfamiliar with those tools then you should check them out until you feel you have a basic understanding of GitHub and a working understanding of Git. Specifcally you should understand how forking, branching, committing, PRing and merging works.
