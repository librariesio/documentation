## Technical Overview

Libraries.io is made up of many smaller projects that work together to keep the [https://libraries.io](https://libraries.io) site running. The following diagram provides a high-level overview: 

![Overview of Libraries.io archiitecture](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1060/22747144/19b1c3ea-ee1e-11e6-93ca-bf505ee5ee6f.png "Libraries.io Architecture")

Everything in Libraries.io begins with [package managers](/packagemanagers.md), on a regular basis background tasks find new or updated libraries from each of those packages managers, libraries cannot be added to the system unless they exist on one of those package managers.

Each library is stored in the [Project](https://github.com/librariesio/libraries.io/blob/master/app/models/project.rb) table, if that library's package manager supports published version numbers each new version is stored in the [Version](https://github.com/librariesio/libraries.io/blob/master/app/models/version.rb) table and if the package manager supports library dependencies then they are recorded in the [Dependency](https://github.com/librariesio/libraries.io/blob/master/app/models/dependency.rb) table.

Libraries.io will then augment package manager data with data from GitHub if one is referenced in the package manager. GitHub repositories will be downloaded and stored in the [GitHubRepository](https://github.com/librariesio/libraries.io/blob/master/app/models/github_repository.rb) table, on creation a background Sidekiq task is kicked off to download related information from GitHub including:

- [Readme](https://github.com/librariesio/libraries.io/blob/master/app/models/readme.rb)
- [Git tags](https://github.com/librariesio/libraries.io/blob/master/app/models/github_tag.rb)
- [Contributors](https://github.com/librariesio/libraries.io/blob/master/app/models/github_contribution.rb)
- Owner ([GitHub user](https://github.com/librariesio/libraries.io/blob/master/app/models/github_user.rb) or [GitHub Org](https://github.com/librariesio/libraries.io/blob/master/app/models/github_organisation.rb))
- Source repository (if it's a fork)
- [Dependency Manifests](https://github.com/librariesio/libraries.io/blob/master/app/models/manifest.rb)

Some package managers that don't have a concept of published versions (like Go and Bower), often they will fall back to using tags from a source repository if available, Libraries.io attempts to use GitHub tags as a fallback for all package managers that don't provide version information.

## Licenses

All license names are ran through the [SPDX](https://github.com/librariesio/spdx) gem to normalize as many different ways of writing the name of standard licenses into a single version, which is then used for filtering within search and listing on https://libraries.io/licenses Licenses are stored as arrays on projects, as a library can have multiple licenses. If a project has a non-standard or commercial license it's currently normalized to "Other" and is not indexed in search.

GitHub repositories have one license stored against them if provided by the [GitHub license API](https://developer.github.com/v3/licenses/), if a library doesn't have any license data from the package manager then it will fall back to using the GitHub license if it's source is on GitHub.
